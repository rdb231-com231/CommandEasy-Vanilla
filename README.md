**************************************************************
  CommandEasy-Vanilla, is an repository which has the purpose of helping you in some ways. Some commands that programmers hate, such like console.log(), here is print() and some commands in printEach().
   You can use this for anything you want, even copy and paste the code and say is yours, this is just an tiny project that anyone could do, even an Junior (like me).
   So, fell free to use this, i'm only doing this for fun. 
   Enjoy.
